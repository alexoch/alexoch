# Welcome on Oleksandr's github page ! 👋

👨‍💻 About Me

I’m a Front-End Developer with 8+ years of experience building high-performance, user-focused web and mobile applications using Vue.js, React.js, Angular, and React Native. I specialize in creating clean, efficient, and scalable front-end architectures that deliver seamless experiences across devices.

At MK-Consulting LLC, I develop and maintain front-end systems, design shared UI libraries, mentor developers, and lead improvements across projects like Prozorro, MedSupply, and internal React tools. My focus includes performance optimization, design consistency, and developer experience.

Previously, I built mobile and web applications from scratch, including Artrevoir, a React Native + Flask app for art education, and custom booking systems that automated operations and boosted sales for clients.

In Nov 2025, I joined the Supabase Lisbon AI Hackathon with my team Chameleon, where we won the Best Use of Figma Make award. We created SuperHeroCV — an AI-powered platform that streamlines job searches with resume parsing, skill matching, and personalized cover letter generation.
